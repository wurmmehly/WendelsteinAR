    <h1 id="objectName">Perseus Galactic Cluster</h1>

    <p id="objectDesc">This photograph is a superposition of three, each taken in different colors: ultraviolet, green, and red, in order to show the center of the Perseus Galactic Cluster, which sits at a distance of about 230 million light years. Large elliptical galaxies, glowing in white-yellow light and holding up to a trillion Sun-like stars, dominate the Cluster's center. Spiral galaxies like our Milky Way can hardly withstand the strong tidal forces of so many stars. If we put the Milky Way in the Perseus Cluster, it would be about the size and look like the blueish spiral galaxies up and to the left of the middle of the image. The many pointlike objects dotting the object belong to either stars within our own Milky Way galaxy or galaxies far behind the Cluster, up to 10 billion light years away. The image is about as wide in the sky as the Moon, which, at the distance the Perseus Galactic Cluster sits, crosses about 2 million light years. This photograph was taken with the widefield camera of the Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope.</p>
