    <h1 id="objectName">Triangulum Galaxy (Messier 33)</h1>

    <p id="objectDesc">The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is, after the Andromeda Galaxy and our own Milky Way, the third-largest galaxy in the local galactic group. M33 is a small spiral galaxy 2.4 million light years away. Uncountably many new stars are being born in its spiral arms. The young, massive stars shine blue and excite interstellar gas to a red-violet. Billions of Sun-like stars lie in the yellow-white background; dust clouds blocking the light from these stars form the darker areas of the galaxy. This photograph was taken by the widefield camera of the Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope, and has an angular diameter close to that of the Moon.</p>
