    <h1 id="objectName">Orion Nebula (Messier 42)</h1>

    <p id="objectDesc">The Orion Nebula is one of the most famous star forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy, about 1,340 light years from Earth. The nebula is shaped by the reddish gas and brown dust. Young, hot stars from the center of the Nebula heat the gas to about 10,000 degrees Celsius, making it produce its own light. Its red color comes from the H-alpha emission line of the atoms in the water gasses, which make up over 70% of the nebula by mass. The image is about as wide in the sky as the Moon, and, at the distance the Orion Nebula sits, crosses about 12 light years. he photograph was taken with the widefield camera of the Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope.</p>
