    <h1 id="objectName">The Spiral Galaxies Messier 65 and Messier 66</h1>

    <p id="objectDesc">Messier 65 (bottom right) and Messier 66 (top left) are part of a galaxy group called the Leo Triplet, which is 32 million light years from Earth and lies in the constellation Leo. M65 resembles our Milky Way galaxy, and both galaxies contain each about 100 billion stars. Both of the galaxies have diameters of about 100,000 light years. The blue light in both galaxies comes from young, massive stars, up to a hundred times the mass of our Sun, while the yellow light comes from stars much like the Sun. The dark filaments are from interstellar dust. The many pointlike objects in the foreground are from stars in our Milky Way galaxy, while the dim, wider objects in the background are much further galaxies. The intergalactic space between M65 and M66 is almost devoid of stars. The picture is about as wide in the sky as the Moon, and was taken in ultraviolet, green, and red light by the widefield camera of the Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope.</p>
