    <h1 id="objectName">The Whirlpool Galaxy (Messier 51)</h1>

    <p id="objectDesc">The Whirlpool Galaxy consists of the spiral galaxy NGC 5194 (below, with similar structure and size to our Milky Way) and its clearly smaller companion NGC 5195 (above). NGC 5195 is in an elliptical, inward-spiraling orbit around NGC 5194, which will lead to a collision between the two galaxies in about 100 million years. The strong tidal forces have already flung millions of stars into intergalactic space and formed diffuse filaments and asymmetric structure, especially around NGC5195. Messier 51 is about 26 million light years from the Earth, meaning the actual gap between the galaxies is about 35,000 light years. The Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope took the photograph in three difference colors -- blue, red, and infrared -- and these were overlayed to produce the above image.</p>
