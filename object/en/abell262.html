    <p id="objectDesc">This photo shows the Abell 262 galaxy cluster and its surroundings, taken in ultraviolet, green, and red light. Abell 262 is about 240 million light years away. The center of the cluster (up in the center) is dominated by elliptical galaxies, which shine yellow, holding up to a trillion Sun-like stars. Some of these galaxies are actively colliding with each other. A spiral galaxy can be seen underneath the center, resembling the Milky Way and with a diameter of about 50,000 light years. The bright, white stars in the foreground belong to the Milky Way, while the dim, mostly red objects are mostly much further galaxies, some up to ten billion light years away. The picture is about as wide as the Moon, matching the Abell 262 cluster's 2 million light year distance. The photograph was taken by the widefield camera of the Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope.</p>
